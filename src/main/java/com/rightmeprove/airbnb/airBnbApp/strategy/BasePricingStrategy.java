/**
 * âš¡ BasePricingStrategy
 *
 * This is the simplest pricing strategy for hotel rooms.
 * It does not apply any dynamic pricing, surge, or discounts.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * 1. Always return the room's base price.
 * 2. Acts as the default strategy in a chain of pricing strategies.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * - If no other strategies (like surge pricing or seasonal adjustments) are applied,
 *   this ensures the system always has a fallback price.
